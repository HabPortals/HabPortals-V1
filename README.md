# HabPortals - Version One
That portal that brings agencies together, by HabboFests

## Default Administration Account
All portals that have been distributed should have a default admin account assigned to each portal. This default admin account must have `all` permissions assigned to the account and must only be accessible by `HabPortals Developers` or `HabPortals Ownership`. When deploying an agency portal, you must assign `one` account only to the person who has approached the ownership in interest of a portal then those people are the responsible to create their agency founders accounts. 

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `hpadmin$32!%`
